// To write good code you need conditional statements based on certain conditions for user


// Use conditional logic with 'if' statement
// if statements are used to make decision in code.
/*
    'if' statement runs code inside curly bracket base on
    defined condition inside '()' round bracket and if codition
    is true , then the code is executed, if its false then rest 
    of code is exicuted 
    
    if(condition is true) {
        statement is executed
    }
*/

// for example: for driving license you should be 18
let age = 18; // try to change this, the console code will not run
if(age >= 18) {  // >= sign check greater or equal to 18 which returns true or false;
    console.log("You are eligible");
}
